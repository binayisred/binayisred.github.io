                Tourism refers to the act of traveling for business or leisure purposes to a location away from your hometown or usual area. Tourism is a dynamic and competitive industry that requires the ability to adapt constantly to customers' changing needs and desires, as customer satisfaction, safety, and enjoyment are particularly the focus of tourism businesses.
                <br><br>
                The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".

                <h3 class="allign01">Why Tourism is important?</h3>
                <br>
                Tourism plays a significant role in Nepal. We can get many advantages from it. Firstly, we can earn
                foreign currency which can be use for our development. Many people have got employed in the offices
                belonging to tourism. Thus, it helps to lessen the problems of unemployment. Tourists buy our goods,
                curios and native articles of our country. By the result, our cottage industries can get benefited.
                Tourism helps our hotel industry. They want to live in good hotels.

                <h3 class="allign01">CHALLENGES OF TOURISM IN NEPAL </h3>
                <h4 class="allign01"> 1. Poor Transportation and Communication Facilities</h4>
                Transportation and communication are the two most
                important pillars of a modern physical era. These facilities are required for the development of the
                tourism sector. But there is a lack of modern transportation and communication facility in Nepal. Due to
                it, the tourism sector is not well developed in Nepal.

                <p>
                <h4 class="allign01">2. Lack of recreation facilities </h4>
                Facilities Recreation is an important part of human life. In Nepal; means of
                recreation like clubs, cinemas theatres, park, hunting, rafting, boating etc. are very limited.
                Therefore, the average length of stay at present for a tourist in Nepal is only about 13 days.

                <p>
                <h4 class="allign01">3. Lack of Development of Tourism Sites</h4>
                Really speaking Nepal is full of natural and pleasant places.
                GosainKund, DudhPokhari, Rara, Dhorpatan, Hile, Shreenagar etc. are the examples. But these places are
                not yet developed as tourism sites. Thus, tourists visiting Nepal return back to their country by
                staying only in Kathmandu and Pokhara.

                <h4 class="allign01">4. Lack of Tourism Centres and Security</h4>
                Tourism centers have been established in Nepal only in limited
                places. These centers provide different tourism services like information about pleasant places, tourism
                maps, exchanging foreign currency etc. for tourists. Due to limited tourist centers, there are
                possibilities for tourists to be cheated.

                <h4 class="allign01">5. Lack of Quality Hotels</h4>
                Good quality hotel and lodges are the choices of foreign tourists. But, such
                good quality hotel and lodges are in limited number in Nepal. Most of these are concentrated only in
                Kathmandu valley which limits/stops foreign tourists only in Kathmandu valley.

                <h4 class="allign01"> 6. Pollution</h4>
               Pollution has become rampant in Nepal. There is pollution in the air, in water, in space,
                on roads and everywhere. Solid waste is not well managed and is spreading everywhere in tourism spots.
                Therefore tourists are becoming hesitant to visit Nepal.

                    <h4 class="allign01"> 7. Lack of Publicity and Advertisement</h4>
                    
                       There is a lack of publicity and advertisement of various
                        tourism sites of Nepal in the international sphere. If this publicity is increased more foreign tourists
                        may visit Nepal and tourism industry of Nepal will develop.
